# prntsc-url-generator
This is a small script I wrote to generate random prnt.sc URLs while messing around with friends. I originally uploaded it here as a way for them to download and use it themselves.

prnt.sc is an image-hosting site used to store screenshots taken with the Lightshot tool. Each image is hosted on a unique, random url comprised of five or six alphanumeric characters.

The script simply generates a random URL and opens a web browser page to automatically navigate to that page.

# How to Use:

All you'll need is a version of python3 installed to run the script. Then simply download the script, change any settings (character list, url length) inside the script that you'd like to, and run the script!

### Note

The screenshots hosted on prnt.sc are not moderated, and you may potentially get personal data or NSFW content.
